This tutorial covers loops and functions.

For odd_loop_v2, we introduce the function 
input() from the standard python library.
We also show by example a loop which prints 
through a range of numbers (from 1 to N). 
Students can practice changing the form of the 
condition but to one that still checks for oddness.

odd_loop_v1 is the same as *_v2 but without the 
input() function accepting external input.

For odd_loop_v3, note the fact that the condition 
in the IF construct needs to evaluate to True 
before the program will run the code in that clause.
Also, mention reason why you should define the function 
before you call it.

Introduce the WHILE loop.
while CONDITION:
    DO SOMETHING
    # but SOMETHING must 
    # cause a change in condition
    # everytime the loop runs

Compare with FOR loop if there is time.
