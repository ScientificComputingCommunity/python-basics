This folder contains 2 python scripts:
quad_v1.py
quad_v2.py

Both scripts have been written to find 
roots of a given quadratic equation. 

You will be asked to modify the given variables
a, b & c and then make further analysis together on 
the results in class.

Understanding the scripts will lead to the final 
question close to the end of the lesson.

What challenges can you face when working with this script? 
What modifications can you make to the code to prevent it 
from breaking when we meet these challenges?

We shall think through these and implement the changes 
in the final parts of the class.
